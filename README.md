# landing-page
Project creating a full web page with the current knowledge I have of HTML and CSS

So before officially starting the project I figured it would be appropriate to set some goals and benchmarks I'll aim for. Also wanted to add, it's something minor, but writing the boilerplate straight from my memory within seconds felt awesome.

So what I'm envisioning for the landing page final draft, it'll focus on four JDM cars that I consider to be the best ever made and ones that would easily be considered the faces of JDM history : Nissan GTR (34 specifically), Toyota Supra (Mk4 specifically), Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (VIII specifically), and last but not least and one of my favorites the Acura(Honda) NSX (97-02 specifically).

So my main goal is to have this project completed within a weeks time because although I don't see it taking that long I feel as though that would still be an adequate amount of time for it to not be rushed but also not prolonged while fitting into my schedule comfortably.

The next is to actually make it a multi page project (only one more page) so that I can get more practice linking together pages and seeing the affect having to apply CSS to two different HTML files feels like.

It's been about three weeks since I started the project and I have no reason that I consider legitimate for why this isn't completed and me not being onto Javascript yet. Yeah I know so much for that week deadline I gave myself, but this is just a minor setback. So I'm gonna make the first landing page as intended that will submit that so I can progress in my learning. But I didn't give up on my original intent for the project and I plan on doing that as a side project while I learn the basics of javascript.
