# landing-page
Project creating a full web page with the current knowledge I have of HTML and CSS

So before officially starting the project I figured it would be appropriate to set some goals and benchmarks I'll aim for. Also wanted to add, it's something minor, but writing the boilerplate straight from my memory within seconds felt awesome.

I haven't figured out the topic I want my page to be on just yet but I'm leaning towards it being about my car, the Lexus IS300. It'll involve a little portion of my personal vehicle on the second page I've decided to implement and mainly just information on the car itself for the main landing page. So I a few minutes later while brainstorming I just had an epiphany : why not make the landing page about JDM cars and that second page can be about my sleeper car

So my main goal is to have this project completed within a weeks time because although I don't see it taking that long I feel as though that would still be an adequate amount of time for it to not be rushed but also not prolonged while fitting into my schedule comfortably.

The next is to actually make it a multi page project (only one more page) so that I can get more practice linking together pages and seeing the affect having to apply CSS to two different HTML files feels like.
