                            Starting from humble beginnings in the 1940‚Äôs, the 
                            small company led by Soichiro Honda developed an engine 
                            for bikes and at the time its success was unwavering but 
                            who knew at the time what the future had in store. Nowadays 
                            you see the history of how they took the vehicle industry by 
                            storm, motorcycles and cars alike, created the luxury brand 
                            Acura, and gems like the k-series motor. Can‚Äôt forget about 
                            their impressive gallery of cars such as the NSX, S2000, and 
                            basically any type r vehicle they‚Äôve made just to name a few.

                            was founded in 1911 by Masujiro Hashimoto but wouldn‚Äôt become an 
                            automotive company until rotating through a few different names and 
                            a merging in the year 1931. Nissan would undergo many name changes 
                            and have to withstand many historic moments backed by its vehicle the 
                            Datsun. Luckily for them in the 50s other countries‚Äô automarket industries 
                            were riddled with gaps that they were able to fill and by doing so 
                            capitalize on the opportunity to really build up the company. Sitting 
                            securely in the ‚Äúpantheon‚Äù of JDM manufacturing like the others mentioned 
                            before it, it also boasts some of the most brag worthy JDM creations like 
                            their Silvia models and most notably, their Skylines. Truly creatures of 
                            beauty made possible by their creation of a top tier icon amongst the best 
                            inline six engines, the RB26DETT engine found in the R32 to the R34.
